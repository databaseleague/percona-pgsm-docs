# Version 2.0.0 (2023-03-20)

| Release date |  March 20, 2023 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | 
| Installation | [Install `pg_stat_monitor`](../install.md) | 

## Release highlights

* `pg_stat_monitor` 2.0.0 is Generally Available with [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://www.percona.com/software/postgresql-distribution), enabling you to use it in production environments. Its improved internal architecture leads to fewer lock acquisitions, and therefore an improved performance by approximately 20% when tested using `pgbench`.
* Added support for PostgreSQL 15 by adding the following columns to `pg_stat_monitor` view:
 
    * `temp_blk_read_time` 
    * `temp_blk_write_time` 
    * `jit_functions` 
    * `jit_generation_time` 
    * `jit_inlining_count` 
    * `jit_inlining_time` 
    * `jit_optimization_count` 
    * `jit_optimization_time` 
    * `jit_emission_count` 
    * `jit_emission_time`

* Improved consistency with `pg_stat_statements` - Now `pg_stat_monitor` view has exactly the same column names, columns and data types as the `pg_stat_statements` view for every major version of PostgreSQL from 11 to 15. 
* Histogram output now allows users to see the whole data range, including the queries with the execution time lower than the minimum time, and exceeding the maximum time specified by the user. 
* The query text is now stored in memory, improving the memory buffer management and preventing its overflow
* CPU and user time are now captured for utility statements, helping you understand the resource consumption for these statements execution. 
* [PMM](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html) integration improvements:
    * An indication of buckets as "done" vs "current" eliminates the need for the tool to evaluate the bucket status and facilitates the accurate data display 
    * The generation of a unique ID of a query, independent from PostgreSQL versions, database, users or schemas, improves observability of query planning, execution and performance

### Incompatibility with previous releases:

* The `pg_stat_monitor_settings` view is deprecated and removed. To retrieve the configuration parameters, use `pg_settings`.
* The following columns are removed for PostgreSQL 12 and earlier: `wal_records`, `wal_fpi`, `wal_bytes`
* Changes to `pg_stat_monitor` view for all PostgreSQL versions:

   | Data type changes | Columns added | Columns renamed | Columns removed |
   | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
   | `userid` - oid <br>  `queryid` - bigint <br> `top_queryid` - bigint <br> `bucket_start_time` - timestamp with time zone | `dbid` <br> `user` | `rows_retrieved` to `rows` <br> `plans_calls` to `calls` | `state` <br> `state_code` 

## New Features

* [PG-586](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-586) - Capture CPU and user timing for utility statements


## Improvements

* [PG-312](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-312), [PG-313](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-313) - Include queries that take less and more than histogram min/max time to histogram
* [PG-321](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-321) - Remove redundant `cmd_type`/`cmd_type_text` columns in `pg_stat_monitor` view.
* [PG-373](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-373) - Remove unused `wal` fields for PG12 and below
* [PG-488](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-488) - Improve the storage mechanism of buckets and query texts using dynamic shared memory for PostgreSQL 15 and onward
* [PG-606](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-606): Add the ability to enable/disable `pgsm_query_id` calculation via a GUC parameter

## Bugs Fixed


* [PG-306](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-306) - Fixed datatype for `bucket_start_time` by changing it to timestamp 
* [PG-320](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-320) - Removed state/state_code fields from pg_stat_monitor_view.

* [PG-576](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-576) - Fixed the issue with incorrect query length in case of a normalized query when the query length exceeds the `PGSM_QUERY_MAX_LEN` value
* [PG-579](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PG-579) - Added a check if `pg_stat_monitor` is loaded in `shared_preload_libraries` before querying the view to prevent the server from crashing
